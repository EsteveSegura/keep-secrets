## Architecture

The architecture of keep-secrets follows a service approach, it does not follow a very focused approach where all services are small (microservices), it is intended to build services with several nested contexts, creating aggregates.

All calls are routed through a gateway which in turn has the ability to do some checks to remove that burden from the rest of the services.
